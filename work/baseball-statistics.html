          A big part of my work at Randall Library involves writing applications 
          for internal use.  Lots of forms, database tables, and reports.  My 
          tool of choice for these kinds of projects is the 
          <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/" target="_blank">Yii PHP 
          Framework</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted an application built with Yii that I could make public, so I 
          wrote Baseball Statistics.  You can use it to explore 142 years of 
          baseball history. Based on the <a 
          href="http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/"
          target="_blank">Lahman Baseball Database</a>, it has the 
          details for every major league player, team and franchise from 1871 
          through 2012.

          In what years did Ted Williams hit 400 or better?  How many times have 
          the New York Yankees been to the World Series?  Baseball Statistics 
          has the answers.
